## Project Description: GearGuard

**GearGuard** is a comprehensive maintenance management system built for the Odoo ecosystem. Its primary objective is to empower companies to track vital assets—ranging from heavy machinery and vehicles to office hardware—while streamlining the entire lifecycle of maintenance requests.

The core philosophy of the module is to create a seamless link between **Equipment** (the asset), **Teams** (the skilled workforce), and **Requests** (the actionable tasks). By integrating these three pillars, GearGuard ensures that no breakdown goes unnoticed and no routine service is forgotten.

### Why GearGuard?

* 
**Centralized Asset Intelligence**: It serves as a master database for all company equipment, tracking technical details, serial numbers, warranty periods, and physical locations.


* 
**Smart Automation**: The system features "Auto-Fill" logic that instantly identifies the correct maintenance team and category when a machine is selected, reducing manual data entry errors.


* 
**Dynamic Workflows**: It handles both unplanned **Corrective** repairs (breakdowns) and scheduled **Preventive** maintenance (routine checkups) through a clear, stage-based progression.


* 
**Technician-First Interface**: Using a visual Kanban board, technicians can manage their workload via drag-and-drop, while managers can monitor performance through color-coded status indicators and overdue alerts.


* 
**Data-Driven Insights**: With built-in reporting via Pivot and Graph views, companies can analyze maintenance trends by team or equipment category to make informed operational decisions.



GearGuard transforms maintenance from a reactive chore into a proactive, organized business process, ensuring that equipment longevity is maximized and operational downtime is minimized.
